## A Prerequisite steps

make sure the following packages are installed:

``` r
install.packages("TraMineR")      # for graphical analysis and research question 4
install.packages("RColorBrewer")  # for grey-shaded graphics
install.packages("gmodels")       # must be installed!
install.packages("MASS")          # must be installed!
install.packages("survival")      # must be installed for research question 3!
install.packages("fpc")           # must be installed for research question 4!
install.packages("cluster")       # must be installed for research question 4!
install.packages("devtools")      # must be installed for installing packages from github
install.packages("lme4")          # must be installed for the multi-level APIM
install.packages("lmerTest")      # must be installed for the multi-level APIM
install.packages("seqHMM")        # must be installed for Markov models
```

Make sure to delete previous Versions of DySeq before installing a new version from GitHub!
``` r
remove.packages("DySeq")      # remove older Version von DySeq     
install_github("PeFox/DySeq") # Install DySeq from GitHub
```

Alternatively, you can install `DySeq` from CRAN. However, the version on CRAN does not feature 
the multi-level approach until the next release!

## B. Example data

The data stems from a study, which was promoted as a study on close relationship and stress. 
Each row represents one dyad, each of them containing two sequences. Dyads are 64 heterosexuel
couples. The females partners were stressed using the Trier Social Stress Test 
(TSST; Kirschbaum, Pirke, Hellhammer, 1993). Directly after the stress induction, both partners joint again and the couple was left alone for eight minutes. During this period (a 'fake' waiting condition) the two partners were filmed for 8 minutes divided into 48 intervals of ten seconds length. It was coded if the female partners showed stress communication (SC) within an interval (sequence 1; Colums 50:97) and if the male partner showd dyadic coping reactions (DC; sequence 2; columns 2:49). For rurther insides about dyadic coping and/or stress communication, see Bodenmann (2015).

```r
library(DySeq)        # loading the DySeq Package
mydata<-CouplesCope   # getting the data
help(DySeq)           # get more information about the data set

# Most following approaches will need combined states!
# The function StateExpand can combine tow sequences into one!
```r
my.expand<-StateExpand(CouplesCope, 2:49, 50:97)
```

# C. Graphical Analysis

Following objects from the previous sections are needed:
- mydata      (the example data)
- my.expand   (the combined sequences)

Following Packages are needed:
- DySeq
- TraMineR
- RColorBrewer

```r
library(TraMineR)     # awesome package for sequence analysis in general!
library(RColorBrewer) # more colours!
citation("TraMineR") # please cite Packages if you use them!
citation("RColorBrewer")
```

### The state distribution plot 


```r
# create labels for plot
couple.labels <-c("none",     # no reaction
                  "SC only",  # only stress communication
                  "DC only",  # only dyadic coping
                  "SC+DC")    # stress and dyadic

# create a stslist object (TraMineR S3-Class)
couple.seq <- seqdef(my.expand,              # the combined states 
                     labels = couple.labels) # the label

# State-Distribution plot 
seqdplot(couple.seq,
         cex.legend=0.8) # adjust size of the legend

# Alternatively a grey version (using RColorBrewer)
# And legend aligned right
attr(couple.seq , "cpal") <- brewer.pal(4, "Greys") # see figure 2
seqdplot(couple.seq, cex.legend=0.8, withlegend="right")
```

### Entropy plot
```r
Entropy <- seqstatd(couple.seq)$Entropy
plot(Entropy, main= "Entropy", col="black", xlab = "Time in 10 sec. intervall", type ="l")
```

### Histogramm of transitions number
```r
SeqL<-seqtransn(couple.seq)
hist(SeqL, main="Number of transitions", xlab="State-transitions")
```

## D. Research Question 1: Is there an association between a particular behavior by one and the reaction by the other partner?

Following objects from the previous sections are needed:
- mydata      (the example data)

Following Packages are needed:
- DySeq

```r
# NumbOccur counts how often a certain behavior is shown within each sequence
SCstress.sumscores<-NumbOccur(x=mydata[,2:49],           # col: 2:49 represent stress communication (SC)
                                          y=1,           # 0=no SC; 1=SC was shown 
                                          prop=FALSE)    # absolute (TRUE) or relative (FALSE) frequency?
                                        
DC.sumscores<-NumbOccur(mydata[,50:97], 1, prop=FALSE)  # Same for dyadic coping (DC)

# Correlation of both frequencies
cor.test(SC.sumscores, DC.sumscores)

# plotting the correlation
plot(SC.sumscores, DC.sumscores, ylab="Number of DC", xlab="Number of SC")
abline(lm(SC.sumscores~DC.sumscores))
```

## E. Research Question 2: Does the behavior of one member trigger an immediate reaction by the other?

Following objects from the previous sections are needed:
- mydata      (the example data)
- my.expand   (the combined sequences)

Following Packages are needed:
- DySeq
- lme4      (for MLM approach)
- lmerTest  (for MLM approach)
- TraMineR  (for the basic Markov model)
- seqHMM    (For the basic Markov model)


### Bakeman & Gottman approach: Step 1

First step is transforming the sequences into transition tables.
That can be done by DySeq's function StateTrans, which stores the transition tables in a list of the class 'state.trans'. 

```r
my.trans<-StateTrans(my.expand,   # the combined sequences
                     first=FALSE) 
```
The argument 'first' specifies which sequence should be used as a dependend variable. 
When my.expand was created, SC was defined as the first sequence and DC as the second sequence. Therefore, DC is now the dependend variable of the transition tables. 

```r
# Just print a state.trans object to get the relative frequencies accross all dyads!
my.trans

# A single case can be plottet by using the [[]] operator
my.trans[[1]] # inspects the first table!

# If the original data.frame containes a ID-variable, the following can be used:
ID<-mydata$code             # stores the ID-variable in the object ID
my.trans[[which(ID==129)]]  # inspects the dyad with ID=129

# If relative frequencies are preferred for single case analysis, just divide the transition table by its sum.
# The following shows an example for the 41th transition table, which belongs to the couple with ID 129. 
# round(x,3) rounds the frequencies to three digits
round(my.trans[[41]]/sum(my.trans[[41]],3)
```
