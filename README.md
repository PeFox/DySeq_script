## A Prerequisite steps

make sure the following packages are installed:

``` r
install.packages("TraMineR")      # for graphical analysis and research question 4
install.packages("RColorBrewer")  # for grey-shaded graphics
install.packages("gmodels")       # must be installed!
install.packages("MASS")          # must be installed!
install.packages("survival")      # must be installed for research question 3!
install.packages("fpc")           # must be installed for research question 4!
install.packages("cluster")       # must be installed for research question 4!
install.packages("devtools")      # must be installed for installing packages from github
install.packages("lme4")          # must be installed for the multi-level APIM
install.packages("lmerTest")      # must be installed for the multi-level APIM
install.packages("seqHMM")        # must be installed for Markov models
```

Make sure to delete previous Versions of DySeq before installing a new version from GitHub!
``` r
remove.packages("DySeq")      # remove older Version von DySeq     
install_github("PeFox/DySeq") # Install DySeq from GitHub
```

Alternatively, you can install `DySeq` from CRAN. However, the version on CRAN does not feature 
the multi-level approach until the next release!

## B. Example data

The data stems from a study, which was promoted as a study on close relationship and stress. 
Each row represents one dyad, each of them containing two sequences. Dyads are 64 heterosexuel
couples. The females partners were stressed using the Trier Social Stress Test 
(TSST; Kirschbaum, Pirke, Hellhammer, 1993). Directly after the stress induction, both partners joint again and the couple was left alone for eight minutes. During this period (a 'fake' waiting condition) the two partners were filmed for 8 minutes divided into 48 intervals of ten seconds length. It was coded if the female partners showed stress communication (SC) within an interval (sequence 1; Colums 50:97) and if the male partner showd dyadic coping reactions (DC; sequence 2; columns 2:49). For rurther insides about dyadic coping and/or stress communication, see Bodenmann (2015).

```r
library(DySeq)        # loading the DySeq Package
mydata<-CouplesCope   # getting the data
help(DySeq)           # get more information about the data set

# Most following approaches will need combined states!
# The function StateExpand can combine tow sequences into one!
```r
my.expand<-StateExpand(CouplesCope, 2:49, 50:97)
```

# C. Graphical Analysis

Following objects from the previous sections are needed:
- mydata      (the example data)
- my.expand   (the combined sequences)

```r
library(TraMineR)     # awesome package for sequence analysis in general!
library(RColorBrewer) # more colours!

# state-distribution plot (using TraMineR) 

# create labels for plot
couple.labels <-c("none",     # no reaction
                  "SC only",  # only stress communication
                  "DC only",  # only dyadic coping
                  "SC+DC")    # stress and dyadic

# create a stslist object (TraMineR S3-Class)
couple.seq <- seqdef(my.expand,              # the combined states 
                     labels = couple.labels) # the label

# State-Distribution plot 
seqdplot(couple.seq,
         cex.legend=0.8) # adjust size of the legend

# Alternatively a grey version (using RColorBrewer)
# And legend aligned right
attr(couple.seq , "cpal") <- brewer.pal(4, "Greys") # see figure 2
seqdplot(couple.seq, cex.legend=0.8, withlegend="right")
```
